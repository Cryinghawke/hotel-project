Basic hotel management system to allow for room and guest managing.

Mock data base files provided for testing purposes.

Future goals :

Add 3rd class - reservations - to allow for check ins and outs dynamically

Add "time" support - to allow for reservations across a period of time i.e weeks, months etc.

Add "write to data base" function - to allow real time work with the system without it being reset to the default information provided.

Include different hotel deparments such as - house keeping, food management, accounting and more.

End game goals :

Design and code a full stack program with a working interface and links to allow for a dynamic program (and not a liniar menu based system) that can be used in the day to day.
